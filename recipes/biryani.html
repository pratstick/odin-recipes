        <p> It's the people's dish. Learn all about biryani â€” the rice dish that unites India's incredibly diverse population.</p>
        <h2>What is Biryani?</h2>
        <p>With more than 1.3 billion people (one-sixth of the world's total population!), 
            India represents nearly every major religion and many ethnic groups within its borders. Its many cuisines reflect that diversity, 
            and biryani is a great example. 
            The spiced rice dish made with vegetables or meat is familiar to all Indians and has countless variations across the country.</p>

        <p>Many Indians are vegetarian or vegan for religious or cultural reasons. 
            The predominant religion in India is Hinduism, and while it doesn't strictly forbid eating meat, it does promote a lifestyle that respects other forms of life. 
            Others eat animal products like milk, eggs, and honey. And there are plenty of people who eat meat, too, so there are many different types of biryani.</p>  
        <h4><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></h4>      
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), or olive oil</li>
            <li>1 red onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seed</li>
            <li>1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>7 peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
            <li>1 tomato, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup peas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced potato</li>
            <li>2 cups basmati rice, rinsed and drained</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><em><strong>Steps</strong></em></h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Melt ghee in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. 
                Stir in cumin seed, cinnamon stick, and peppercorns; 
                cook until the spices are fragrant, and the cumin seeds begin to pop, about 3 minutes.</li>

            <li>Stir in ginger garlic paste, tomatoes, and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a simmer, and cook until the water has evaporated, about 5 minutes. 
                Stir in peas, carrot, and potato. 
                Season with chicken bouillon, salt, red chile, black pepper, garam masala, and turmeric. Stir well, then cover, and cook for 3 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Pour in 4 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat. 
                Once boiling, stir in basmati rice, reduce heat to medium, recover, and simmer for 10 minutes. 
                Reduce heat to low and continue to cook until the rice has softened, 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>   

        </ol>
